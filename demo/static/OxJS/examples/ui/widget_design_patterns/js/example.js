**Parasitic Inheritance**
*/
/*
The following examples illustrate the common design pattern for `OxJS` UI
widgets: an inheritance model that is neither classical nor prototypal, but
"parasitic" (a term coined by <a
href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html">Douglas
Crockford</a>).

In a nutshell, "instances" are created by augmenting other
instances, but in addition to private members (`var foo`) and public members
(`that.bar`), they can have shared private members (`self.baz`). `self` cannot
be accessed from outside, but since `self` itself is an argument of the
"constructor", an instance can inherit its parent's `self` by passing its own
`self`.

'use strict';


/*
Create our own namespace. Not required, but if we wanted to create a module
named `My`, this is how we would do it.
*/
Ox.My = {};

/*
**Box**
*/
/*
First, lets build the most basic Box widget. A widget is a "constructor"
function that takes two (optional) arguments, `options` and `self`, and returns
a widget object. It's not a constructor in JavaScript terms though: It doesn't
have to be called with `new`, and doesn't return an `instanceof` anything. It
just enhances another widget object and returns it.
*/
Ox.My.Box = function(options, self) {

    /*
    This is how every widget "constructor" begins. `self` is the widget's shared
    private object.
    */
    self = self || {};
    /*
    `that` is the widget itself, its public object, or, in JavaScript terms, its
    `this`. Every widget "inherits" from another widget by simple assignment.
    All public properties of the "super" widget, i.e. all properties of its
    `that`, will be present on our own `that`. In this case, we use Ox.Element,
    the "root" widget at the end of the inheritance chain, and pass an empty
    options object. But we always pass our own `self`, which means that any
    property that Ox.Element (or any other widget in the inheritance chain) adds
    to `self` will be present on our own `self`.
    */
    var that = Ox.Element({}, self)
        /*
        Then we call the public `defaults`, `options` and `update` methods of
        Ox.Element. `defaults` assigns the defaults object to `self.defaults`
        and copies it to `self.options`, `options` extends `self.options` with
        the options object, and `update` adds one or more callbacks that are
        invoked whenever, by way of calling the `options` method, a property of
        `self.options` is modified or added.

            size: setSize

        /*
        `addClass` is a jQuery method. In fact, Ox.Element (and any widget
        derived from it) provides, on its prototype, all methods of a jQuery
        `$('<div>')`. Chaining works too: If you have `var $d = $('<div>'), $e =
        Ox.Element();`, then `$d.appendTo($e)` returns `$d`, and `$e.append($d)`
        returns `$e`. If you type `Ox.Element()` in the console, you will get
        something like `[<div class="OxElement"></div>]`. Any widget's `0`
        property is an actual DOM element, and in case you ever need the
        jQuery-wrapped element &mdash; that's the widget's `$element` property.

        The purpose of the `OxMyBox` class is just to allow us to add CSS
        declarations in an external style sheet. In this case, `.css({float:

    widget's color and size.
    
    We could have used `var minSize` and `var maxSize` here, but by using `self`
    for private variables that we want to be accessible across all the widget's
