/*
The idea (a slight variation of a proposal by <a href="http://extendny.com/"
target="_blank">Harold Cooper</a> is to extend the Manhattan Grid in all
directions, so that every point on Earth can be addressed as "Xth Ave & Yth St".

The origin of this coordinate system is the intersection of Zero Ave (a.k.a.
Avenue A) and Zero St (a.k.a. Houston St). Avenues east of Zero Ave, just as
Streets south of Zero St, have negative numbers. Broadway, which will split not
only Manhattan but the entire globe into an eastern and a western hemisphere,
retains its orientation, but is adjusted slightly so that it originates at the
intersection of Zero & Zero. From there, Broadway, Zero Ave and Zero St continue
as perfectly straight equatorial lines. All three will intersect once more,
exactly halfway, in the Indian Ocean, (southwest of Australia), at the point
furthest from Manhattan.

As subsequent avenues remain exactly parallel to Zero Ave, and subsequent
streets exactly parallel to Zero St, they form smaller and smaller circles
around the globe. The northernmost and southernmost streets are small circles
in Central Asia (east of the Caspian Sea) and the southern Pacific (near Easter
Island), the westernmost and easternmost avenues small circles in the North
Pacific (west of Hawaii) and the South Atlantic (near St. Helena). These four
extreme points are the North Pole, South Pole, West Pole and East Pole of the
coordinate system.
